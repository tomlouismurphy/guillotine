Guillotine User Stories

A novice player will begin by reviewing the rules and card types of Guillotine, located in an instruction manual that is available prior to game start. They will then need to be prompted throughout the actual gameplay of any mistakes that they make in trying to play cards and take turns.

An experienced player of the physical card game will need to know what card types and functionalities may be missing from this version as opposed to the one they're familiar with. For instance, if a player is counting on the card to turn gray victims into 1 pointers for his/her strategy. Perhaps a change list would be useful.

A history buff may want more context for some of the names or titles that show up over the course of the game - Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, any others I decide to add - and will be inclined to follow links to wikipedia or other sources to get the background.

Players who only have 5-10 minutes rather than the full time to play the game may want an option to play with just 1 day - loop that into the build.

Conversely, people learning the game, especially in a one-on-one context, may be interested in tracking their results in a long-term sense - perhaps a high score or W-L record could be useful.

People may be particularly confused by the mechanisms in the game that award bonus points for specific classes of noble or remove collected nobles from one's total score. A movelog could be useful to track through score or property changes.

This is a game where the rules are likely possible enough for kids to play, but it might not be ideal from a thematic perspective - guillotines and the like. Might need a reskin that plays down the death.

Sometimes people are bad at math. Action cards that move nobles ahead 3 or 4 places in the line might be miscalculated by the player, so they'll need confirmation of the place where the card will be going.

TODO - afternoon, 10/4

# guillotine
A Javascript 2-player version of the 1998 card game Guillotine

This is an online game inspired by Guillotine, a 2-5 player game published in the 1990s - a campy, cartoonish sort of card game set during the French Revolution.

The game is programmed using Javascript and jQuery, with all functions written in ES6 format.

When the game loads on a browser, click on the red "New Game!" button to begin the first round of play.
It will load a two-player game, with Player 1 designated as the first to play and Player 2 to follow.

Plans for further development:
At present, the game currently includes 48 action cards - a future expansion will hopefully add an extra 10-20 cards to that deck.
While the original game could handle 2-5 players, this version is only built for two players. Adding functionally for 3, 4 or 5 players is a future goal.
I plan to add a feature that will, in some cases, add additional effects on scoring or gameplay after some nobles are collected.

An instruction manual for this game is included in a separate file.
